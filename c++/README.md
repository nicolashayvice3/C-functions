This here is just me learning C++, nothing too major. Getting the basic understanding of how to use the language well :D

If you want to test out each function you will have to 1- fork or clone the repository
                                                       2- type in terminal the following: g++ {exampleFileName} 
                                                                                       3: ./a.out
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have done that it should run in your terminal.
If you wish to make changes and run it again you will have to do step 2 & 3 again.
